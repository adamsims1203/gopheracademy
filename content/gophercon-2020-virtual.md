Greetings from Florida: the hotspot of Covid 19 infections in the United States.

![Daily Infections](/images/dailycases.png)

Things aren't turning out the way any of us would have predicted at the beginning of the year. Even in our last update we were hopeful that this pandemic would be just a bad memory by the time November's Gophercon event happened in Orlando. Instead, Florida now accounts for more than 10% of the Covid 19 related deaths in the United States.

We can't in good conscience invite anyone to our home state with conditions such as these. We've made the only decision that we could; we're canceling the in-person event and moving to an online-only Gophercon. 

Our online conference will consist of _mostly_ the same high-quality programme that we would have delivered in person. We know that we'll have to make a few adjustments to our plans because of the new format.

# Here's What This Means For You

Gophercon 2020 Online will still be a live conference with hosts, workshops, and of course, amazing presentations.

* If you've purchased a ticket for Gophercon 2020, we will refund the difference between the in-person rates and the online rates.
* If you've purchased a ticket for a pre-conference workshop nothing will change.  The workshops will move to online delivery, but at the same time on the same day.

We've been working hard with our sponsors to bring you an event that meets our high standards and still provides them value for their investment in our community.




Sincerely,

Brian Ketelsen and Erik St. Martin

_Your GopherCon 2020 Hosts_
