## CFP
The <a href="http://gophercon.com">GopherCon 2015</a> CFP was an incredible success. We received over 164 submissions from people all over the world. Our panel of 12 Go community members worked tirelessly to review and rate each proposal. It was a challenge to limit the talks to just 22, we only wish we had more speaking slots to fill.

We'd like to thank everyone who took the time to submit a proposal and especially our review committee and our program coordinator Dave Cheney.
