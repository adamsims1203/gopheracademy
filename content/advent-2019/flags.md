In a [previous article](TODO) we discussed why command line applications are
important and talk about few guidelines. In this article we'll see how we can
use the built-in [flag](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/) package to write command
line applications.

There are other third-party packages for writing command line interfaces, see
[here](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#command-line) for a list. However
depending on third-party package [carries a
risk](https://research.swtch.com/deps) and I prefer to use the standard library
as much as I can.

## Converting Time Zones

Let's write a small application to convert time from one time zone to the
other.
