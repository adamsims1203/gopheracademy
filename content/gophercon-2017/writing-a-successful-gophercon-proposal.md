[The GopherCon 2017 Call for Proposals](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon2017) has reached the halfway mark so I wanted to pass on advice to potential speakers who are planning to submit a proposal but may be unsure how to go about it.

# Consider your audience.

This year we're asking for proposals for three different kinds of talks; keynotes, tutorials, and workshops.
The audience for each kind of talk is different.

For keynotes, you'll be speaking to the entire audience, 1500 people whose experience with Go will span everything from beginners, to long time GopherCon attendees, to the Go team themselves.
This means your topic should be relevant to a wide audience.

This does not mean pitching to the loweset common denominator and trying to sell the audience on the benefits of using Go.
The audience have already invested time and money in flying to Denver to visit the conference -- they already think Go is pretty great.
Instead, you want to inspire the audience to convince _other_ people that Go is great, and do that by presenting information that is relevant to Go programmers today.

For tutorials, you have more time, up to 45 minutes, and an audience who are self selecting; they have chosen to come to your talk over the other two talks at the same time.
You can afford to present in depth on a topic and be prepared to take questions.

For workshops, again you have more time, the whole day, to instruct students who have chosen to attend your specific workshop.

# Keep it relevent

GopherCon is not a general programming conference, the GopherCon audience are expecting to hear about Go.
If your proposal doesn't mention Go at all, or a reader could substitute the name of another programming language for Go without changing the message of your proposal, you need to dig deeper to find the relevance for a Go programming audience.

# Keep it fresh

Our audience invests a lot in attending the conference and they expect GopherCon to continue its tradition of featuring new speakers and new ideas.
The reality of our online connected world is many talks are recorded and widely circulated.
Our audience will not be happy to attend a conference composed of talks they think they've already seen.

If you've presented a talk at a meetup or other conference and plan to propose it for GopherCon, by all means do so, but think about how you can incorporate the feedback you received and how the landscape may have changed since you gave your presentation last.

# Writing a good GopherCon proposal

The review team have no access to any other information about you, or your proposal save what you have written in the title, abstract, and details fields.
Your job is to convince the reviewers that you can deliver an engaging, relevant, and informative presentation using only those three fields.

## Title

Keep it short, pithy, and to the point.
Maybe it could be a little punny, or a little cryptic, but please avoid 8 shocking things that make your proposal read like a Buzzfeed headline.

## Abstract

Just the facts.
One sentence that describes the topic that you'll be talking about, and one sentence that describes what the audience will take away from listening to your talk or partipating in your workshop, is all you need.
But, just like a tweet, make those sentences count.

## Detail

The details section is where many proposals have traditionally come up short.
To be blunt, many proposals across the years have not included enough detail for the reviewers to judge them according to the selection criteria.

What we encourage speakers to do every year is including in their proposal:

1. A paragraph or two of introduction, ideally the introduction you plan to use in your talk.
2. An outline of the presentation itself. Bullet points are fine. The goal of including an outline is twofold, to demonstrate to the readers that you've thought about how your talk will flow from the questions you pose in your introduction, to the answers in your conclusion.
3. A paragraph or two of conclustion, again ideally this would be the conclustion you plan to use in your talk.

There is no required word limit, but if you haven't writen at least 400-500 words, you're probably selling your talk short and putting yourself at a disadvantage. 
Simply put, proposals will less detail are rarely chosen over proposals with a lot of detail, we cannot stress this enough.

# Addressing the selection criteria

The review team score each proposal according to the following review criteria:

- **Relevance**: Is this topic interesting to an audience of Go programmers? What is it about the topic that is unique to its use of Go?
- **Novelty and Originality**: Does the talk provide the audience with new information? Preference will be given to presentations not previously available to a wide audience.
- **Knowledge**: Has the speaker demonstrated a strong understanding of their subject?
- **Coverage**: Does the proposal cover the topic in depth? What are the main insights?
- **Organization**: Is the proposal well organized? Will the audience tune into the narrative? Will the speaker use their time effectively?
- **Bottom Line**: What’s the takeaway of your talk? How will the presentation improve attendees’ knowledge, outlook, and inspiration?

Each of the six criteria are equally important.
The reviewers will be looking to answer each of these questions when scoring your proposal -- make it easy for them. 

# Don't wait til the last minute.

Look, I understand, if I had a bill due on the 31st, then I wouldn't dream of paying it ahead of time, but submitting a conference proposal is different.

If your proposal is interesting to the reviewers, and it's clear you've made an effort to write a proposal that addresses the selection criteria, but something is missing, then we'll tell you what's missing and encourage you to update your proposal.
But after the 31st of January what's in your proposal is final.
So please, do not wait until the last day to submit your proposals as we cannot offer feedback after the CFP is closed.

# Questions

If you have questions, or want advice, you can contact the organisers [gophercon@gopheracademy.org](mailto:gophercon@gopheracademy.org) or in the [#gophercon-denver](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/gophercon-denver/) slack channel (If you need an invite to the Gophers' slack, [use this link](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)).

See you all in July.
